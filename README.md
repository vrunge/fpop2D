## Quick Start

`fpop2D` is an R package written in Rcpp/C++ providing efficient change-point detection algorithms for 2d time-series analysis. The main goal of this package is to ease simulation studies for comparing **pruning efficiency** and **time complexity** for different pruning strategies for a few 2d time-series problems.

More to come in following months.
